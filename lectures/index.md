## Schedule 2016-2017


Lectures are organized in two introduction lectures and three general topics. The introduction lectures introduce software languages in general and imperative and object-oriented languages in particular.

The first topic focuses on declarative specification of compiler components as supported by state-of-the-art tools for compiler construction, including lexical syntax, context-free syntax, static semantics, and code generation.

In the second topic, we address techniques for the compilation and runtime environments of imperative and object-oriented languages, including data-flow analysis, register allocation, virtual machines, and memory management in detail.

In the final topic, we take a closer look on the inside working of compiler components and their generators. In particular, we study parsing algorithms and parser generation.
